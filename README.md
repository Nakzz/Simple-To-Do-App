## Notes

I had been stuck on this error for a while:
 ERROR: x86 emulation currently requires hardware acceleration
 
 I looked at different solutions on StackOverflow forum but I coudn't find any solution but then realized this issue correlated to creating a virtual instance. I had solved an issue relating to this prior by enabling Intel Virtualization from BIOS and that fixed the issue.
